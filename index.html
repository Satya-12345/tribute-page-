          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, full name <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul
            Kalam</b>, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, a small town in
            Tamil Nadu, India. He hailed from a humble background and grew up in
            a financially modest family. Kalam showed early interest and
            aptitude in science and engineering. He pursued his education at
            Saint Joseph's College in Tiruchirappalli, where he studied physics.
            After completing his undergraduate studies, he moved to Madras (now
            Chennai) to study aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of
            Technology (MIT). He specialized in Aeronautical Engineering and
            graduated in 1958. The term "Missile Man of India" refers to Dr.
            A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who was a renowned scientist and served as the
            11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Dr. Kalam was often
            referred to as the "Missile Man of India" because of his significant
            contributions to the development of India's missile and space
            technology programs. During his career at the Defense Research and
            Development Organization (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO), Dr. Kalam played a pivotal role in the
            development of various missile systems, including the Agni and
            Prithvi series of ballistic missiles. He also contributed to the
            successful development of India's first indigenous satellite launch
            vehicle, the SLV-3, and the operationalization of the Polar
            Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch
            Vehicle (GSLV). Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was widely respected for his
            scientific expertise, visionary leadership, and commitment to
            advancing India's missile and space programs. He was not only a
            scientist but also a great teacher, writer, and motivator who
            inspired many young minds in India and around the world.
